# A Web Developer and UI Designer with a passion for user-experience-driven projects âœ¨

I'm a creative thinker who loves turning complex ideas into simple and beautiful user interfaces. I'm always learning and exploring new things!

## What I'm Working On ðŸ”§

A project I'm currently deeply involved in is **[Organized](https://github.com/sws2apps/organized-app)** â€“ a powerful web app designed for Jehovah's Witnesses by a team of truly fantastic developers and designers! It's built to help everyone in a congregation with their assignments and responsibilities.

## Leveling Up My Skills ðŸš€

Right now, I'm diving deep into **JavaScript** and **TypeScript** to later move on to React.js to build more powerful web apps.
